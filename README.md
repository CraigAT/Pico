## Pico F-Won

A simple low-graphics game using the Pico Display, measuring reaction times by simulating a F1 racing lap.

Features:
 - Jazzy intro screen
 - Menu selection for 3 (real) tracks
 - Racing start on random side
 - Authentic turn timings (Taken from real F1 pole laps)
 - Finish line with chequered flag
 - Final lap time delta

## How to play

 - Hold Pico Display in landscape mode with the RGB LED to the left
 - Admire the brief intro screen
 - Select a track from the menu
 - From here on in your reaction times are being recorded
 - Watch the 5 red lights illuminate then go out after a random delay
 - Press the indicated button B or Y to get off the line
 - For each of the next turns (up to 20) click the indicated turn button B or Y
 - A green light will be shown whilst travelling flat out donw the straights
 - After the final straight the chequered flag will be shown
 - And your total reaction time (lap delta) will be displayed
 - After a short pause the game will loop back to the intro screen

Disclaimer : If you experience any issues please disconnect the Pico, reconnect and re-run the code.
